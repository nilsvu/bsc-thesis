abstract = {We present the first results based on Planck measurements of the CMB temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. The Planck spectra at high multipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter LCDM cosmology. In this model Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision. We find a low value of the Hubble constant, H0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc and a high value of the matter density parameter, Omega\_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreement with constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent-level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We present results from an analysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured significantly over standard LCDM. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find a 95\% upper limit of r<0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles. Using BAO and CMB data, we find N\_eff=3.30+/-0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the summed neutrino mass. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of N\_eff=3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy. Despite the success of the standard LCDM model, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the CMB power spectrum at low multipoles, as noted previously by the WMAP team. While not of decisive significance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data.},

abstract = {Modified gravity theories on cosmic scales have three key deviations from general relativity. They can cause cosmic acceleration without a physical, highly negative pressure fluid, can cause a gravitational slip between the two metric potentials, and can cause gravitational waves to propagate differently, e.g. with a speed different from the speed of light. We examine whether the deviations in the metric potentials as observable through modified Poisson equations for scalar density perturbations are related to or independent from deviations in the tensor gravitational waves. We show analytically they are independent instantaneously in covariant Galileon gravity -- e.g. at some time one of them can have the general relativity value while the other deviates -- though related globally -- if one deviates over a finite period, the other at some point shows a deviation. We present expressions for the early time and late time de Sitter limits, and numerically illustrate their full evolution. This in(ter)dependence of the scalar and tensor deviations highlights complementarity between cosmic structure surveys and future gravitational wave measurements.},

abstract = {These lectures on the cosmological constant problem were prepared for the X Mexican School on Gravitation and Mathematical Physics. The problem itself is explained in detail, emphasising the importance of radiative instability and the need to repeatedly fine tune as we change our effective description. Weinberg's no go theorem is worked through in detail. I review a number of proposals including Linde's universe multiplication, Coleman's wormholes, the fat graviton, and SLED, to name a few. Large distance modifications of gravity are also discussed, with causality considerations pointing towards a global modification as being the most sensible option. The global nature of the cosmological constant problem is also emphasized, and as a result, the sequestering scenario is reviewed in some detail, demonstrating the cancellation of the Standard Model vacuum energy through a global modification of General Relativity.},

I begin with a description of the initial conditions problems of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology and then explain how inflation, an early period of accelerated expansion, solves these problems. Next, I describe how inflation transforms microscopic quantum fluctuations into macroscopic seeds for cosmological structure formation. I present in full detail the famous calculation for the primordial spectra of scalar and tensor fluctuations. I then define the inverse problem of extracting information on the inflationary era from observations of cosmic microwave background fluctuations. The current observational evidence for inflation and opportunities for future tests of inflation are discussed.

abstract = {We study the effects of a modified speed of gravitational waves (tensor modes), \$c\_T\^{}2\$ on the B-modes of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy in polarisation. We find that a departure from the light speed value would leave a characteristic imprint on the BB spectrum part induced by tensors, manifesting as a shift in the angular scale of its peaks. We derive constraints by using the available Planck and BICEP2 datasets showing how \$c\_T\^{}2\$ can be measured, albeit obtaining weak constraints due to the overall poor accuracy of the current BB power spectrum measurements. The present constraint corresponds to \$c\_T\^{}2 = 1.30 \backslash pm 0.79\$ and \$c\_T\^{}2< 2.85\$ at \$95\backslash\%\$ C.L. by assuming a power law primordial tensor power spectrum and \$c\_T\^{}2<2.33\$ at \$95\backslash\%\$ C.L. if the running of the spectral index is allowed. We derive forecasts for the next generation CMB satellites, which we find capable of tightly constraining \$c\_T\^{}2\$ at percent level, comparable with bounds from binary pulsar measurements, largely due to the absence of degeneracy with other cosmological parameters.},

abstract = {The sensitivity of resonant detectors for gravitational waves (GW) is discussed. It is shown that a resonant detector equipped with a quantum limited amplifier can have a bandwidth up to 50 Hz or more. Cryogenic resonant antennas are today in operation and data are being recorded by ALLEGRO, AURIGA, EXPLORER, NAUTILUS and NIOBE. The sensitivity for pulse detection is now h ∼ 4.10-19 (corresponding to a total energy of less than 0.001 solar masses for a source in the Galactic Center). The sensitivity for monochromatic waves is h ∼ 2 . 10-25 for one year of integration and h ∼ 7 . 10-22 1/Hz for a stochastic background detection. Initial results are given and perspectives for resonant detectors are illustrated. Recently an intriguing result, a sidereal time effect, has been found when searching for coincidences between EXPLORER and NAUTILUS with data taken in the years 1998 and 2001. We report also on large signals observed with the NAUTILUS detectors in coincidence with cosmic ray showers. Plans for the construction of large spherical detectors that should reach at 1 kHz a spectral sensitivity of the order of h ∼7.10-241/Hz are reported.},

The science products include maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, and diffuse foregrounds in temperature and polarization, catalogues of compact Galactic and extragalactic sources (including separate catalogues of Sunyaev-Zeldovich clusters and Galactic cold clumps), and extensive simulations of signals and noise used in assessing the performance of the analysis methods and assessment of uncertainties. The likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the Planck data are described, as well as a CMB lensing likelihood. Scientific results include cosmological parameters deriving from CMB power spectra, gravitational lensing, and cluster counts, as well as constraints on inflation, non-Gaussianity, primordial magnetic fields, dark energy, and modified gravity.},

abstract = {This article aims at discussing the cosmological constant problem at a pedagogical but fully technical level. We review how the vacuum energy can be regularized in flat and curved space-time and how it can be understood in terms of Feynman bubble diagrams. In particular, we show that the properly renormalized value of the zero-point energy density today (for a free theory) is in fact far from being 122 orders of magnitude larger than the critical energy density, as often quoted in the literature. We mainly consider the case of scalar fields but also treat the cases of fermions and gauge bosons which allows us to discuss the question of vacuum energy in super-symmetry. Then, we discuss how the cosmological constant can be measured in cosmology and constrained with experiments such as measurements of planet orbits in our solar system or atomic spectra. We also review why the Lamb shift and the Casimir effect seem to indicate that the quantum zero-point fluctuations are not an artifact of the quantum field theory formalism. We investigate how experiments on the universality of free fall can constrain the gravitational properties of vacuum energy and we discuss the status of the weak equivalence principle in quantum mechanics, in particular the Colella, Overhauser and Werner experiment and the quantum Galileo experiment performed with a Salecker-Wigner-Peres clock. Finally, we briefly conclude with a discussion on the solutions to the cosmological constant problem that have been proposed so far. © 2012.},

The main goal of Euclid is to understand the origin of the accelerated expansion of the Universe. Euclid will explore the expansion history of the Universe and the evolution of cosmic structures by measuring shapes and redshifts of galaxies as well as the distribution of clusters of galaxies over a large fraction of the sky. Although the main driver for Euclid is the nature of dark energy, Euclid science covers a vast range of topics, from cosmology to galaxy evolution to planetary research. In this review we focus on cosmology and fundamental physics, with a strong emphasis on science beyond the current standard models. We discuss five broad topics: dark energy and modified gravity, dark matter, initial conditions, basic assumptions and questions of methodology in the data analysis. This review has been planned and carried out within Euclid's Theory Working Group and is meant to provide a guide to the scientific themes that will underlie the activity of the group during the preparation of the Euclid mission.},

No eclipses are observed. We infer that the unseen companion is a compact object with mass comparable to that of the pulsar.

abstract = {A stochastic background of gravitational waves is expected to arise from a superposition of a large number of unresolved gravitational-wave sources of astrophysical and cosmological origin. It should carry unique signatures from the earliest epochs in the evolution of the Universe, inaccessible to standard astrophysical observations. Direct measurements of the amplitude of this background are therefore of fundamental importance for understanding the evolution of the Universe when it was younger than one minute. Here we report limits on the amplitude of the stochastic gravitational-wave background using the data from a two-year science run of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). Our result constrains the energy density of the stochastic gravitational-wave background normalized by the critical energy density of the Universe, in the frequency band around 100 Hz, to be <6.9 x 10(-6) at 95\% confidence. The data rule out models of early Universe evolution with relatively large equation-of-state parameter, as well as cosmic (super)string models with relatively small string tension that are favoured in some string theory models. This search for the stochastic background improves on the indirect limits from Big Bang nucleosynthesis and cosmic microwave background at 100 Hz.},

We show that the totality of cosmological information on the gravitational sector can be compressed - without any redundancy - into five independent and arbitrary functions of time only and one constant. These describe physical properties of the universe: the observable background expansion history, fractional matter density today, and four functions of time describing the properties of the dark energy. We show that two of those dark-energy property functions control the existence of anisotropic stress, the other two - dark-energy clustering, both of which are can be scale-dependent. All these properties can in principle be measured, but no information on the underlying theory of acceleration beyond this can be obtained. We present a translation between popular models of late-time acceleration (e.g. perfect fluids, f (R), kinetic gravity braiding, galileons), as well as the effective field theory framework, and our formulation. In this way, implementing this formulation numerically would give a single tool which could consistently test the majority of models of late-time acceleration heretofore proposed.},

We show that, in very general classes of models extending gravity -- all scalar-tensor theories (Horndeski), Einstein-Aether models and bimetric massive gravity -- a direct correspondence exists between the appearance of scalar anisotropic stress in cosmological solutions and a modification in the propagation of gravitational waves. If these phenomena are present, they are both active during the same cosmological time. The appearance of anisotropic stress is therefore an unambiguous signature of a modification of gravity. Since the anisotropic stress can be measured in a model-independent manner, a comparison of the behavior of gravitational waves from cosmological sources with large-scale-structure formation could in principle lead to new constraints on the theory of gravity.},

These subjects have been intensively studied over the past decade, largely motivated by rapid progress in the field of observational cosmology that now allows, for the first time, precision tests of fundamental physics on the scale of the observable Universe.

abstract = {Nonlinear, ghost-free massive gravity has two tensor fields; when both are dynamical, the mass of the graviton can lead to cosmic acceleration that agrees with background data, even in the absence of a cosmological constant. Here the question of the stability of linear perturbations in this theory is examined. Instabilities are presented for several classes of models, and simple criteria for the cosmological stability of massive bigravity are derived. In this way, we identify a particular self-accelerating bigravity model, infinite-branch bigravity (IBB), which exhibits both viable background evolution and stable linear perturbations. We discuss the modified gravity parameters for IBB, which do not reduce to the standard \$\backslash Lambda\$CDM result at early times, and compute the combined likelihood from measured growth data and type Ia supernovae. IBB predicts a present matter density \$\backslash Omega\_\{m0\}=0.18\$ and an equation of state \$w(z)=-0.79+0.21z/(1+z)\$. The growth rate of structure is well-approximated at late times by \$f(z)\backslash approx\backslash Omega\_\{m\}\^{}\{0.47\}[1+0.21z/(1+z)]\$. The implications of the linear instability for other bigravity models are discussed: the instability does not necessarily rule these models out, but rather presents interesting questions about how to extract observables from them when linear perturbation theory does not hold.},

abstract = {These notes present a brief introduction to `naturalness' problems in cosmology, and to the Cosmological Constant Problem in particular. The main focus is the `old' cosmological constant problem, though the more recent variants are also briefly discussed. Several notions of naturalness are defined, including the closely related ideas of technical naturalness and `t Hooft naturalness, and it is shown why these naturally arise when cosmology is embedded within a framework --- effective field theories --- that efficiently captures what is consistent with what is known about the physics of smaller distances. Some care is taken to clarify conceptual issues, such as the relevance or not of quadratic divergences, about which some confusion has arisen over the years. A set of minimal criteria are formulated against which proposed solutions to the problem can be judged, and a brief overview made of the general limitations of most of the approaches. A somewhat more in-depth discussion is provided of what I view as the most promising approach. These notes are aimed at graduate students with a basic working knowledge of quantum field theory and cosmology, but with no detailed knowledge of particle physics.},

Lovelock gives an explicit description of all second-order natural (0,2)-tensors on X that are symmetric and divergence-free. Apart from the dual metric, the Einstein tensor of g is the simplest example.In this paper, we give a short and self-contained proof of this theorem, simplifying the existing arguments by formalizing the notion of derivative of a natural tensor. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{LIGO2015,
abstract = {The Advanced LIGO gravitational wave detectors are second-generation instruments designed and built for the two LIGO observatories in Hanford, WA and Livingston, LA, USA. The two instruments are identical in design, and are specialized versions of a Michelson interferometer with 4 km long arms. As in Initial LIGO, Fabry–Perot cavities are used in the arms to increase the interaction time with a gravitational wave, and power recycling is used to increase the effective laser power. Signal recycling has been added in Advanced LIGO to improve the frequency response. In the most sensitive frequency region around 100 Hz, the design strain sensitivity is a factor of 10 better than Initial LIGO. In addition, the low frequency end of the sensitivity band is moved from 40 Hz down to 10 Hz. All interferometer components have been replaced with improved technologies to achieve this sensitivity gain. Much better seismic isolation and test mass suspensions are responsible for the gains at lower frequencies. Higher laser power, larger test masses and improved mirror coatings lead to the improved sensitivity at mid and high frequencies. Data collecting runs with these new instruments are planned to begin in mid-2015.},

@article{Planck2015MG,
abstract = {We study the implications of Planck data for models of dark energy (DE) and modified gravity (MG), beyond the cosmological constant scenario. We start with cases where the DE only directly affects the background evolution, considering Taylor expansions of the equation of state, principal component analysis and parameterizations related to the potential of a minimally coupled DE scalar field. When estimating the density of DE at early times, we significantly improve present constraints. We then move to general parameterizations of the DE or MG perturbations that encompass both effective field theories and the phenomenology of gravitational potentials in MG models. Lastly, we test a range of specific models, such as k-essence, f(R) theories and coupled DE. In addition to the latest Planck data, for our main analyses we use baryonic acoustic oscillations, type-Ia supernovae and local measurements of the Hubble constant. We further show the impact of measurements of the cosmological perturbations, such as redshift-space distortions and weak gravitational lensing. These additional probes are important tools for testing MG models and for breaking degeneracies that are still present in the combination of Planck and background data sets. All results that include only background parameterizations are in agreement with LCDM. When testing models that also change perturbations (even when the background is fixed to LCDM), some tensions appear in a few scenarios: the maximum one found is $\backslash$sim 2 sigma for Planck TT+lowP when parameterizing observables related to the gravitational potentials with a chosen time dependence; the tension increases to at most 3 sigma when external data sets are included. It however disappears when including CMB lensing.},

@article{Xu2015,
abstract = {In a modified gravity theory, the propagation equation of gravitational waves will be presented in a non-standard way. Therefore this tenor mode perturbation of time-space, as a complement to the scalar mode perturbation, provides a unique character distinguishing modified gravity from general relativity. To avoid the model-dependent issue, in this paper, we propose a parametrised modification to the propagation of gravitational waves. We show the effects on the angular power spectrum of cosmic microwave background radiation due to the parametrised modification and its degeneracy to the tensor mode power spectrum index \$n\_t\$ and its running \$\backslash alpha\_t\$. At last, we report the current status on the detection of modified gravity through the currently available cosmic observations. Our results show no significant deviation to general relativity.},

These make use of the fact that relative motion of mass points, or strains in a crystal, can be produced by second derivatives of the gravitational fields. The strains in a crystal may result in electric polarization in consequence of the piezoelectric effect. Measurement of voltages then enables certain components of the Riemann tensor to be determined. Mathematical analysis of the limitations is given.

@article{Planck2013,
abstract = {The ESA's Planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early universe, was launched on May 2009 and has been surveying the microwave and submillimetre sky since August 2009. In March 2013, ESA and the Planck Collaboration publicly released the initial cosmology products based on the first 15.5 months of Planck operations, along with a set of scientific and technical papers and a web-based explanatory supplement. This paper describes the mission and its performance, and gives an overview of the processing and analysis of the data, the characteristics of the data, the main scientific results, and the science data products and papers in the release. Scientific results include robust support for the standard, six parameter LCDM model of cosmology and improved measurements for the parameters that define this model, including a highly significant deviation from scale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. The Planck values for some of these parameters and others derived from them are significantly different from those previously determined. Several large scale anomalies in the CMB temperature distribution detected earlier by WMAP are confirmed with higher confidence. Planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and has measured gravitational lensing of CMB anisotropies at 25 sigma. Planck finds no evidence for non-Gaussian statistics of the CMB anisotropies. There is some tension between Planck and WMAP results; this is evident in the power spectrum and results for some of the cosmology parameters. In general, Planck results agree well with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Because the analysis of Planck polarization data is not yet as mature as the analysis of temperature data, polarization results are not released. We do, however, illustrate the robust detection of the E-mode polarization signal around CMB hot- and cold-spots.},

For dilatation symmetric quantum theories realistic asymptotic cosmology is obtained provided the effective potential has a nontrivial minimum. For theories with dilatation anomaly one needs as a nontrivial “cosmon condition” that the energy-momentum tensor in the vacuum is purely anomalous. Such a condition is related to the short distance renormalization group behaviour of the fundamental theory. Observable deviations from the standard hot big bang cosmology are possible.},
